# nvim config

> This is my personal NeoVim config that I configured for development and documenting.

All config based on [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim).
I've tried a lot of different distros (kickstart, astro, chad) and decided to create custom (yeah...).

It is very simple and opionated but contains everything I need for the moment.

## Setup

First backup and move previous config:

```bash
mv ~/.config/nvim ~/.config/nvim.YYYY-MM-DD
```

```bash
git clone git@github.com:niklucky/nvim-config.git ~/.config/nvim
```

## Tech stack

Something was setup and tested because I need it right now, something I will setup later.
